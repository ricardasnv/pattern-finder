PATTERN FINDER TOOL FOR SUBSTITUTION CIPHER ANALYSIS

Usage:
./patternfinder <file to analyze> <min. pattern length> <max. pattern length> <repeat threshold (default = 1)>

Example:
Perform frequency analysis on lipsum-rot13.txt:     ./patternfinder lipsum-rot13.txt 1 1 | sort -n
Find common 3-letter sequences in lipsum-rot13.txt: ./patternfinder lipsum-rot13.txt 3 3 | sort -n

Simple tool that finds repeating patterns in a given file and counts the occurences of each. Special case <max. pattern length> = <min. pattern length> = 1 performs a frequency analysis.
